<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p><strong>DownloadMate</strong> was built by the developer Cem Levent Avcı as a free app. This SERVICE is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This page is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>

<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. We do not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>DownloadMate does not collect personal information such as name, email, or contact details. However, to perform media downloads from platforms like YouTube, Instagram, or Twitter, we require platform-specific session cookies, which are obtained via in-app login pages.</p>
<p>These cookies are stored locally on your device and are used solely to authorize downloads through our FastAPI backend. They are never uploaded, stored in a cloud database, or shared with any third parties.</p>

<p><strong>Backend Service Usage</strong></p>
<p>When initiating a download, necessary information such as the media URL, chosen format, and relevant cookies are sent to our FastAPI backend to process the request. No data is logged or stored on our servers after the download is completed.</p>

<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
<p>In case of an error, we may collect limited diagnostic data (such as device type, OS version, or time of failure) for debugging purposes. These logs are not linked to any personal identifiers and are only used to improve app stability.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>DownloadMate uses cookies only as required to authenticate with supported platforms for downloading media. These cookies are handled within the app and are never shared outside the device. Refusing cookies may prevent successful downloads from certain platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
<p>We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising services. All interactions happen either locally on your device or via our self-hosted backend server, which does not retain user data.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We value your trust in using our service and we take reasonable steps to secure the data stored locally. However, remember that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p>This app may contain embedded login pages from external platforms. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or content of those platforms. We encourage users to read their respective privacy policies.</p>

<p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
<p>DownloadMate does not target anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are a guardian and believe your child has used this app, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately.</p>
